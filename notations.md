# Before getting started

The notations used here are those specified in [SSI Notation Conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Qy9FaHbq8zti4lprOcgmi_ArRgnWtlADVT8tipSTxk)
The first time a key word is used in the document, it will be in __boldface__. If its meaning is not clear, please look up [Sovrin Glossary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1giOzpTFXypJ6bAUp_6g93kYOEiNa5eWI1KeIg6wb598)

# Notations

Entities (people, institutions, things) that own identities are represented by uppercase letters 
(generally the first letter of the entity's name). For instance A for Alice and B for Bob.

A pairwise relationship is represented using a colon notation. For instance A:B for the relationship A with respect to B (The words "with respect to" 
are used here to indicate that the relationship has a direction). Similarly, B:A represents a relationship of B with respect to A. 
A multi-way relatonship (>2 entities involved) is represented by A:ABCD (where there are 4 entities A,B,C and D involved)

__Agents__ are represented with numbers. That the agents and entities belong to a __sovereign domain__ or in general a 
particular context is represented using the @ symbol. So, 1@A is used to represent Alice's agent (1, which is, let's say, Alice's 
__Identity Wallet__) in Alice's sovereign domain.
